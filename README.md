# Lab 01 – Products, Architecture & Roles

To kickstart the course, you will explore two things:
>
> 1) How real software products are structured;
> 2) What kind of engineers build and operate them.
>
## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab you should be able to:

- Use GitHub to structure your work and collaborate with peers (issues, branches, pull requests, and reviews).
- Explain the basic architecture of a real-world digital product in terms of components, data flow, deployment, and tech roles.
- Reflect on your career in tech, examine your current skillset, and plan for the future.

## Tasks overview

To complete this lab, you will need to:

- Set up your `GitHub` account and this lab's repo.
- Pick an existing digital product.
- Sketch its architecture: components, data flow, deployment.
- Map components to tech roles and skills using real job postings and `roadmap.sh`.
- Practice using GitHub issues, branches and pull requests (PRs) to organize your work in a repository (repo) and get feedback from peers.

This and all other lab assignments will simulate real-life engineering practices:

- Follow processes;
- Communicate via issues/PRs;
- Keep the work reviewable;
- Write acceptance criteria;
- Write clear commit messages.

## Repo structure

- [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-task.yml`](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-task.yml) - an issue form for a task.
- [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](./.github/pull_request_template.md) - a template for PRs.
- [`./docs/diagrams`](./docs/diagrams) - diagrams of the product's architecture.
- [`./.vscode/settings.json`](./.vscode/settings.json) - `VS Code` settings.
- [`./.vscode/extensions.json`](./.vscode/extensions.json) - recommended `VS Code` extensions.

## Submission checklist

By the end of the lab:

- Make sure that each task that you have completed has a corresponding issue linked to a PR.
- Close the issues for which all related activities are done.
- Show your progress to the TA as your proceed with the lab. TA will share a link to the table to mark the status of your tasks.

---

## Procedure for each task

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure is based on the [`GitHub flow`](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow).

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue) a `GitHub` issue in your forked repo using the `Lab Task` [issue form](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms).
2. Create a new branch for the issue via [`GitHub`](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue) or via `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
3. <details><summary> Make <a href="https://smartprogramming.in/tutorials/git-and-github/git-commit">commits</a> to that branch to complete the task (click to expand).</summary>

     - Commit messages must follow the [`Conventional Commits`](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.
     - Commit to the branch using one of these approaches:
       1. Using `VS Code` (see [docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/staging-commits)): `Activity Bar` -> `Source Control` -> Click a file -> Select lines in the editor -> Right mouse click the selected lines -> Click `Stage Selected Ranges` -> Write a commit message -> Click `Commit`.
       2. Using a terminal (adds all changes in these files to the staging area):

          ```console
          git add <file 1> <file 2> ... <file n>
          git commit -m "<message>"
          ```

   </details>

4. Push the branch to your forked repo:

    ```console
    git push -u origin <branch-name>
    ```

5. Create a PR to the `main` branch via [`GitHub`](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) ([tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git/creating-a-pull-request-on-any-public-repository-from-github-using-vs-code/)) or via the [`GitHub Pull Requests` extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github#_pull-requests).
6. Write an appropriate PR description following the PR template.
7. [Link the PR](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) to the issue, e.g. `Closes #<issue number>`.
8. [Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review#requesting-reviews-from-collaborators-and-organization-members) a review of the PR from the collaborator.
9. Get the collaborator comments and address them, e.g., make fixes or ask to clarify the comment.
10. Get the collaborator to approve the PR.
11. Merge the PR to the `main` branch.
12. Close the issue.
13. Delete the branch.

## PR reviews

As a PR reviewer, you must:

- Review the assigned PR.
- Leave at least 2 meaningful comments highlighting [particular lines](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#adding-comments-to-a-pull-request).
- Approve the PR if you're satisfied with the PR.

As a PR author, you must:

- Reply to comments in a meaningful way, e.g., write “Fixed in d0d5aeb” (`d0d5aeb` being the id of commit where you addressed the comment), ask to clarify the comment, or explain why you disagree.
- Make necessary changes based on the review.
